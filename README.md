# Spatial_FFPE
This repository aims to share the R codes used in Spatial_FFPE project

DBiT-seq was a spatial multiomic sequencing technique that can also be used for FFPE sample sequencing. 

This repository includes the main R code used for the visualization of the sequencing data, including clustering, Differential expression gene analysis and cell annotation with reference scRNA-seq data. 

One MATLAB script to automatic identify pixels on tissue was also included.
