DBiT-seq was a spatial multiomic sequencing technique that can also be used for FFPE sample sequencing. 

For data preprocessing and generation of expression matrix from raw data, please refer to https://github.com/MingyuYang-Yale/DBiT-seq

This repository includes the main R scripts used for the visualization of the sequencing data, including clustering, Differential expression gene analysis and cell annotation with reference scRNA-seq data. 

One MATLAB script to automatic identify pixels on tissue was also included.
